# Dactyl-Joakim

This is a slight modification of the [Dactyl-ManuForm](https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard), made for use with Nice!Nano using ZMK firmware. The layout used is also Nordic, so some modification might be needed.

## 3D-prints

3D-prints used are in the prints/ folder.

## Soldering

The board has been soldered using the same layout as the original Dactyl-ManuForm, using the corresponding pins on the Nice!Nano. To make it easier to change the switches, I have soldered the wires to hotswap sockets instead of directly to the switches.

## Parts used

- Nice!Nano v2 (one for each half)
- LiPo batteries
- 1N4148 Signal Diodes
- M3x5.7x5.0 Heat inserts for 3D-prints.
- M3x10mm screws.
- Kailh hotswap sockets
- Gateron Phantom Browns (any cherry like switches will do)
- Some keycaps
- Time and patience.
